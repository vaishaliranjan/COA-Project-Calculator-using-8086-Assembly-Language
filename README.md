### :woman_technologist: Introduction

Assembly language, also known as assembler language, is a low-level
programming language that’s designed to communicate instructions with
specific computer hardware and direct the flow of information. It does this
using human-readable mnemonics (consisting of mnemonics like “LDA”
to represent load accumulator) to form short code that makes it easier for
the person trying to complete the work. These short codes are converted
into machine learning language (binary, i.e., 1s and 0s) through the use of
programs called assemblers.

A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations like addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division.

In this project we have computed the assembly language code (8086) to do
the some basic arithmetic operations.

### :zap: Conclusion

After complete execution of code we were able to successfully compute
the basic instruction of calculator like addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division in 8086 emulator.
Assembly language is not a day-to-day language but a computer
engineering developer should know the assembly language so that by the
piece of code one can understand what is going in the central processing
unit and most important thing about assembly language is where a person
wants to work at byte-bit level.
